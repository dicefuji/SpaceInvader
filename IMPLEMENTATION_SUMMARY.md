# Space Invaders with Prolog AI - Implementation Summary

## Completed Implementation

We've successfully implemented a playable Space Invaders game with the following features:

### Game Engine
- Core entity system with base class for all game objects
- Player spaceship with movement, shooting, and lives system
- Alien invaders with movement patterns and shooting
- Defensive barriers with segment-based damage system
- Bullet implementation for both player and aliens
- Collision detection and response
- Game state management (menu, playing, game over)
- Score tracking and high score
- Win/loss conditions

### UI Components
- Game menu screen
- In-game HUD (score, lives)
- Game over screen
- Win screen
- Status indicators

### Prolog AI Integration
- Prolog knowledge base for alien behavior
- Python-Prolog bridge for communication
- Fallback behavior when Prolog is unavailable
- State serialization for Prolog inference
- Action mapping from Prolog decisions to game actions

## Game Variants

1. **Standard Version (space_invaders.py)**
   - Uses hardcoded AI behavior for aliens
   - Full game state management
   - Score tracking and lives system

2. **Prolog AI Version (space_invaders_prolog.py)**
   - Uses Prolog for alien decision making
   - Same game features as standard version
   - Shows Prolog status in UI

## Core Components Structure

- **engine/entity.py**: Base class for all game objects
- **engine/player.py**: Player implementation with bullets
- **engine/alien.py**: Alien invaders implementation
- **engine/barrier.py**: Defensive barriers implementation
- **engine/game_state.py**: Game state management
- **engine/ui.py**: User interface components
- **engine/config.py**: Game constants and settings

## AI Components Structure

- **ai/invader_ai.pl**: Prolog knowledge base
- **ai/prolog_bridge.py**: Python-Prolog communication bridge

## Installation and Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Pygame
- SWI-Prolog (optional, for Prolog AI version)
- pyswip (optional, for Prolog AI version)

## Testing Utilities

- **test_components.py**: Test the basic game components
- **test_prolog_integration.py**: Test the Prolog integration

## Next Steps

See NEXT_STEPS.md for planned future enhancements.

## Core Features

- Classic Space Invaders gameplay with modern enhancements
- Object-oriented design with clear separation of concerns
- Prolog AI integration for alien behavior (with Python fallback)
- Multiple difficulty levels and scoring system
- Lives, barriers, and game state management

## Architecture

- Python/Pygame for game engine and graphics
- Prolog for alien AI decision making
- PrologBridge class for Python-Prolog communication
- Entity system for game objects (player, aliens, bullets, etc.)
- GameState manager for handling different game states

## AI Strategy System

### Row-Based Strategy Implementation

The game now implements a row-based strategy system where each row of aliens uses a different strategy:

1. **Row 1 (Red)**: Direct Targeting - Fires when player is directly below
2. **Row 2 (Green)**: Predictive Targeting - Predicts player movement and fires ahead
3. **Row 3 (Blue)**: Random Firing - Random chance to fire with no targeting
4. **Row 4 (Yellow)**: Coordinated Firing - Only bottom aliens in each column fire
5. **Row 5 (Purple)**: Barrier Avoidance - Avoids firing when barriers would block shots

Each strategy is color-coded for visual identification, creating a more diverse and readable gameplay experience. As players destroy different rows, the strategic challenge evolves naturally.

### Implementation Details

- Prolog knowledge base with strategy-specific firing rules
- Visual indicators using color-coding for each strategy
- Python fallback behavior when Prolog initialization fails
- Testing tools for analyzing strategy effectiveness
- Statistical tracking of strategy performance

### Strategy Analysis

Extensive testing has shown each strategy has distinct strengths and weaknesses:

- Direct Targeting is most effective against stationary players
- Predictive Targeting works best against players moving consistently in one direction
- Random Firing creates unpredictable threats that require constant awareness
- Coordinated Firing concentrates firepower from the aliens closest to the player
- Barrier Avoidance ensures efficient resource use by avoiding blocked shots

Together, these strategies create a balanced and challenging gameplay experience that adapts to different player behaviors.

## Key Components

- `space_invaders_prolog.py`: Main game file with row-based strategy UI
- `ai/invader_ai.pl`: Prolog knowledge base with strategy rules
- `ai/prolog_bridge.py`: Python-Prolog communication bridge
- `test_prolog_integration.py`: PrologAlien and PrologAlienGroup classes
- `test_row_strategies.py`: Testing tool for strategy analysis
- `engine/`: Core game components (entities, physics, rendering)

## Future Improvements

- Fix Prolog initialization issues for more elegant AI implementation
- Add level-specific strategy layouts
- Implement adaptive strategies based on player performance
- Create complex formations with mixed strategies
- Add additional alien types with unique behaviors

## Conclusion

The row-based strategy system significantly enhances the game's tactical depth and visual appeal. Players can more easily understand and adapt to the varied attack patterns through color-coding, while each row presents a unique challenge to overcome.
