## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Enhanced Row Strategy System
Build upon the row-based strategies by adding level-specific layouts, adaptive difficulty, and more complex behavior patterns.

### Phase 2: Prolog Stability
Fix the Prolog initialization issues and optimize the Python-Prolog bridge for better performance and reliability.

### Phase 3: Gameplay Expansion
Add level progression, more enemy types, and expand the gameplay mechanics to create a more complete gaming experience.

### Phase 4: Visual and Audio Polish
Enhance the visual presentation with better sprites, animations, and effects, and add sound effects and music.

### Phase 5: Final Integration and Release
Complete all outstanding items, perform thorough testing, and prepare the final release version.
